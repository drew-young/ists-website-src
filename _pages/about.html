  <h1>Who?</h1>
  <p>
    ISTS is hosted by RITSEC, the student-run computer security club at the
    Rochester Institute of Technology. All of the event planning, content
    creation, and day-of volunteering is done by dedicated members of RITSEC.

    All teams that compete at ISTS are composed entirely of college students.
    Each year, several universities around the country are invited to send a
    team to ISTS. RIT students form the remaining teams.
